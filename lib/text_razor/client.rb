require 'httpclient'

module TextRazor

  # * The main TextRazor client.  To process your text, create a :class:`TextRazor`
  # instance with your API key and set the extractors you need to process the text.
  # Calls to :meth:`analyze` and :meth:`analyze_url` will then process raw text or URLs,
  # returning a :class:`TextRazorResponse` on success.
  #
  # This class is threadsafe once initialized with the request options.
  # You should create a new instance for each request if you are likely to be changing
  # the request options in a multithreaded environment.
  #
  # Below is an entity extraction example from the tutorial, you can find more examples at
  # http://www.textrazor.com/tutorials.
  #
  # >>> client = TextRazor("DEMO", ["entities"])
  # >>> client.set_do_cleanup_HTML(true)
  # >>>
  # >>> response = client.analyze_url("http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18640916")
  # >>>
  # >>> entities = list(response.entities)
  # >>> entities.sort { |e1, e2| e1.relevance_score <=> e2.relevance_score } .reverse
  # >>>
  # >>> seen = Set.new
  # >>> entities.each do |entity|
  # >>>   if entity.id not in seen:
  # >>>     print entity.id, entity.relevance_score, entity.confidence_score, entity.freebase_types
  # >>>     seen.add(entity.id)
  # >>> end
